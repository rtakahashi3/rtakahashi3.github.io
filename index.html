                <p class="paragraph one">
                    ELIZA is one of the earliest chatbots to exist, 
                    where it was developed by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT 
                    in the mid-1960s. The intention for the creation of 
                    this program was to explore and demonstrate
                    communication between humans and machines by using
                    pattern matching and substitution technology. 
                    Since the program was limited by its fairly simple
                    scripts of codes, a lot of amateur coders played
                    around creating different variations of the original 
                    chatbot. The most well known variation was called 
                    DOCTOR, which was made to respond and interact like 
                    a Rogerian psychotherapist by turning the questions 
                    back to the patient to reflect on their questions.

                    <p class="paragraph one">
                        I found this chatbot interesting because this is 
                        the first artificial intelligence chatbot to ever 
                        exist that could somewhat mimic human conversation, 
                        and it actually successfully helped some people 
                        psychologically and even the creator Weizenbaum wrote 
                        "I had not realized ... that extremely short exposures 
                        to a relatively simple computer program could induce 
                        powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people" 
                        (Weizenbaum 7).

                <p class="paragraph two">
                    GERTY is a chatbot that appears in the movie Moon. Moon is 
                    a science fiction film about the protagonist Sam nearly 
                    approaching the end of his three year contract working alone 
                    in a facility on the moon. He also has a personal assistant 
                    called GERTY to talk to provided by the company Sam works 
                    for, which is an AI that works to assist Sam from the 
                    difficulties that he faces. One day, Sam crashes his rover 
                    turning him unconscious, but he then wakes up in the base 
                    infirmary without any memory of the accident, while GERTY 
                    assists him and tells him that a rescue team is on their 
                    way. However, Sam ignores GERTY’s warnings and decides to 
                    go outside and finds another version of himself inside the 
                    rover that crashed. Sam wonders if it’s a clone of himself, 
                    but it is revealed by GERTY that both Sams were clones, and 
                    that he was the one who implanted Sam’s memory to the new 
                    clone. Both dismayed, the older Sam starts to discover the 
                    company’s secrets, where he accesses the records of the past 
                    clones who all became dysfunctional after the three year 
                    contract with the help of GERTY and a secret vault that 
                    stores a lot of Sam’s clones, which meant that the corporation 
                    has been using Sam’s clones for the entire time created just 
                    to perform the same work every three years to save costs for 
                    another worker, while acting as if they were sending him back 
                    to earth after the contract. Later, the two Sams decide that 
                    the newer Sam goes back to earth with the incoming rescue team, 
                    while the older Sam goes back to the accident site, and rebooted 
                    GERTY to wipe the records of these events since GERTY advised 
                    them to do so.

                    I found this movie very interesting especially because of the 
                    big twist in the plot and the AI assistant GERTY not going 
                    against humans but instead helping Sam and even revealing the 
                    corporation’s secrets even though the corporation doesn’t want 
                    Sam to know about their corrupted secrets, and how a lot of other 
                    science fiction works tend to have AI going against humans.

                <p class="paragraph three">
                    Siri is a digital assistant chatbot on Apple devices that uses 
                    natural language UI and is often considered the first widely 
                    adopted voice assistant on phones. While Siri was originally 
                    released as an iOS app in February 2010, Apple acquired it two 
                    months after its release and integrated it as an official feature 
                    of the iPhone 4S with its release on October 4th, 2011. Ever 
                    since officially becoming part of the iPhone 4S, Siri became an 
                    essential part of other Apple Products including the iPhone 
                    models released in the future, and it has been adapted into other 
                    hardware products from Apple such as the iPad, iPod Touch, Mac, 
                    AirPods, Apple TV, HomePod, and Apple Vision Pro. Some of the 
                    features included in this chatbot include sending messages, 
                    making calls and reminders, searching for things using the web, 
                    and all others just through the use of voice commands, 
                    eliminating the need for manual input such as navigating through 
                    menus.

                        I found this chatbot interesting because this form of chatbot 
                        ultimately caused a huge transition from traditional 
                        command-based interactions to human-like conversational forms 
                        of AIs with way more intelligence than ever. I also found it 
                        fascinating how this technology expanded the adoption of AI in 
                        the general public.

                <p class="paragraph four">
                    Tay is an AI chatbot on Twitter developed by Microsoft’s 
                    programmers back in 2016 to appeal to the millennials and 
                    understand human conversations by interacting with them and 
                    learning through other users’ posts. While it seemed to be an 
                    interesting idea with Microsoft claiming the more you talk to her 
                    the smarter she becomes, Microsoft had to quickly shut down Tay 
                    because she was tweeting the most horrific racial slurs on the 
                    platform in less than a day after its release, as the AI system 
                    lacked judgment in morality and a subset of people on the 
                    platform decided to abuse that by interacting with the chatbot 
                    using hateful comments, which quickly led to Tay tweeting 
                    offensive and hurtful tweets.

                        reminds us the AI can quickly absorb and replicate the bad 
                        aspects of human behavior especially when the chatbot is 
                        unregulated as such.

                <p class="paragraph five">
                    I believe AI is not something to be feared or worried about because 
                    it rather represents how technology has evolved over the last few 
                    decades, and it should instead be used as a rapidly evolving tool 
                    that we can take advantage of and improve our lives from it.
                </p>
                <h3 class="extraheading">Are current AIs actually sophisticated enough?</h3>
                <p class="paragraph five">
                    While AIs have evolved significantly thoughout the recent years, I 
                    still think they have room for a lot of improvements because current 
                    AI chatbots still tend to struggle with understanding the user's input, 
                    and they still fall significantly behind human intelligence, meaning that
                    they will most likely remain as tools that will help humans instead of 
                    completely wiping the necessity of human work.
