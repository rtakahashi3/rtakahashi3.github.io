                    ELIZA is one of the earliest chatbots to exist, 
                    where it was developed by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT 
                    in the mid-1960s. The intention for the creation of 
                    this program was to explore and demonstrate
                    communication between humans and machines by using
                    pattern matching and substitution technology. 
                    Since the program was limited by its fairly simple
                    scripts of codes, a lot of amateur coders played
                    around creating different variations of the original 
                    chatbot. The most well known variation was called 
                    DOCTOR, which was made to respond and interact like 
                    a Rogerian psychotherapist by turning the questions 
                    back to the patient to reflect on their questions.
